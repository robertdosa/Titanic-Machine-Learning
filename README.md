# Titanic-Machine-Learning
Applying different machine learning algorithms on the famous Titanic dataset


The purpose of this repository to demonstrate different classification algorithms on the same dataset. Since it is a well-known dataset I did not made any exploratory data analysis. Different notebooks will be add in the future.
