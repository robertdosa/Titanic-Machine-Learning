# Titanic-Machine-Learning
Applying different machine learning algorithms on the famous Titanic dataset

Source of the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data


The purpose of this repository to demonstrate different classification algorithms on the same dataset. Since it is a well-known dataset I did not made any exploratory data analysis. Different notebooks will be add in the future.


Let's have a look at the dataset.

Variable Notes (Source: Kaggle)

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
